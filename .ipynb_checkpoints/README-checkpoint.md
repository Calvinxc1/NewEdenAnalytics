## New Eden Analytics Codebase

#### Description

The New Eden Analytics codebase is a repository for my code on the biggest personal project I have: Applying Data Science and Data Engineering techniques to my favorite video game, EVE Online. In the game I am a dedicated industrialist, and this project supports that. The project currently consists of the following pieces:

* [Web Application](https://github.com/Calvinxc1/NewEdenAnalytics/tree/master/website)
* [ESI API Parsers](https://github.com/Calvinxc1/NewEdenAnalytics/tree/master/python/api)
* [SDE Parser](https://github.com/Calvinxc1/NewEdenAnalytics/tree/master/python/sde)
* [Analytics Playground](https://github.com/Calvinxc1/NewEdenAnalytics/tree/master/playground)

It's been a fantastic experience working on this project, and this project has helped me become a professional Data Scientist. I keep working on it as it's a passion project.

#### Contributing

This is primarily a project I work on in my own time, but anyone is welcome to contribute to it. No promises of your contributions making it into the Master branch though ;-)
